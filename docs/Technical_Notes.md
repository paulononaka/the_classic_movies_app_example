# Technical Notes - The Classic Movies App

The Classic Movies App was built to demonstrate how to build solid architectural principles with a focus on maintainability and scalability with Flutter. While there are areas for improvement, the foundation is strong and provides a good basis for future enhancements. The modular approach, clean architecture, and attention to details like error handling and feature flags make it a well-designed Flutter application.

## Technical Analysis

### Architecture Overview
- **Modular Architecture**: The application is structured into distinct modules (core, design_system, movies) with clear separation of concerns.
- **Clean Architecture Principles**: The codebase follows a layered approach with domain, data, and presentation layers.
- **Dependency Injection**: Uses GetIt as a service locator for managing dependencies across the application.
- **State Management**: Implements a controller-based approach with ChangeNotifier for reactive UI updates.

### Technical Stack
- **Flutter Framework**: Cross-platform UI toolkit
- **Firebase Services**: Remote Config for feature flags, Core for initialization
- **Dio**: HTTP client for API communication
- **Hive**: Local storage solution for caching
- **Sentry**: Error monitoring and reporting
- **GetIt**: Dependency injection framework

### Code Organization
- **Core Module**: Contains shared utilities, services, and base classes
- **Design System Module**: Manages UI components, themes, and styles
- **Movies Module**: Implements the main feature set with proper separation of concerns
  - Data Sources (Remote/Local)
  - Repositories
  - Controllers
  - UI Components

## Key Issues Identified

### Strengths
1. **Well-Implemented Feature Flags**: The FeatureToggleService provides a robust mechanism for enabling/disabling features remotely.
2. **Comprehensive Error Handling**: Custom NetworkException with detailed error messages and proper localization.
3. **Caching Strategy**: Effective implementation of local caching with Hive for offline access.
4. **Logging & Monitoring**: Integration with Sentry for production error tracking and structured logging.
5. **Modular Design**: Clear boundaries between modules with well-defined interfaces.

### Areas for Improvement
- **Image caching**: No proper image caching strategy implemented.
- **Environment variables in CI/CD**: Environment variables need to be properly passed using dart-define in the CI/CD pipeline and potentially encrypted for security.
- **Web platform issues**: Web platform stopped working and requires further investigation.
- **Favorites functionality**: The feature to mark and save favorite movies is not yet implemented.
- **CI/CD release pipeline**: The release process is not automated in the CI/CD pipeline.

## Technical Rationale for Current Implementation

### Repository Pattern
- **Rationale**: Provides a clean abstraction over data sources, enabling seamless switching between remote and local data.
- **Implementation**: MoviesRepositoryImpl orchestrates between remote and local data sources with proper error handling.

### Feature Toggle Service
- **Rationale**: Enables controlled feature rollout and A/B testing capabilities.
- **Implementation**: Firebase Remote Config integration with type-safe feature definitions and runtime updates.

### Error Handling Strategy
- **Rationale**: Provides meaningful error messages to users while capturing detailed diagnostics for developers.
- **Implementation**: Custom exceptions with localized messages and integration with Sentry for monitoring.

### Dependency Injection
- **Rationale**: Facilitates testability and loose coupling between components.
- **Implementation**: GetIt service locator with proper registration of dependencies at application startup.
